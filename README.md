# SQL-DATA PREPARATION FOR ANALYSIS
**Project Title: Peparing The Layoffs Dataset For Analysis**

**Overview:**
This project focuses on preparing a layoffs dataset obtained from Kaggle to prepare it for accurate and efficient analysis. The process involved creating structured tables, standardizing data formats, and removing inconsistencies to ensure the dataset's quality and usability. The project is designed for both technical and non-technical audiences interested in understanding data cleaning and preparation techniques.

The SQL code used for cleaning and standardizing the dataset is provided in the **`preparation.sql`** file, and the original dataset is available in the **`layoffs_dataset.csv`** file.

**Key Data Preparation Steps:**
1. **Creating Tables:** Designed structured tables to organize the data logically and efficiently.
2. **Inserting Data into Tables:** Loaded the raw data from the CSV file into SQL tables for further processing.
3. **Standardizing Data:** Ensured consistent formats for dates, text fields, and numerical values.
4. **Handling Missing Values:** Removed null and blank entries to maintain data integrity.
5. **Removing Irrelevant Data:** Dropped unnecessary columns and filtered out irrelevant records to focus on meaningful insights.

**Project Files:**
- **`Cleaning_and_Standardizing.sql`**: Contains all SQL queries used in the cleaning and standardization process, structured for clarity and reusability.
- **`layoffs_dataset.csv`**: The raw dataset from Kaggle, used as input for the cleaning process.

**Purpose:**
This project highlights the importance of data preparation as a crucial step in any data analysis workflow. By improving the dataset's quality and consistency, it sets the foundation for reliable and insightful analyses. Whether you're a technical professional exploring SQL techniques or a non-technical stakeholder interested in the preparatory steps for data analysis, this project provides a clear and practical demonstration.
